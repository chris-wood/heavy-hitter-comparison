    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide variety of proposed solutions to the heavy hitters problem, ranging from [Poplar](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/017.pdf) to [STAR](https://brave.com/research/files/star-ccs-2022.pdf). Conveniently, both Poplar and STAR can be viewed as a form of [VDAF](https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf/draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf.html), or verifiable distributed aggregation function. A VDAF is a multi-party protocol between clients and one or more aggregators for computing aggregate statistics. The protocol consists of the following phases:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Sharding: Computing input shares from an individual measurement. For convenience, we also refer to this phase as the Uploading phase.\n",
    "- Preparation: Conversion and verification of input shares to output shares compatible with the aggregation function being computed.\n",
    "- Aggregation: Combining a sequence of output shares into an aggregate share.\n",
    "- Unsharding: Combining a sequence of aggregate shares into an aggregate result. For convenience, we also refer to this phase as the Finalization phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these phases has an associated cost, where cost is measured in terms of network messages, bandwidth, and computation. For convenience, let $\\mathsf{C}_{\\mathsf{phase}}^{\\mathsf{property}}(\\pi)$ be the cost of some property of a particular phrase for a VDAF $\\pi$. For example, $\\mathsf{C}_{\\mathsf{upload}}^{\\mathsf{bw}}(\\mathsf{STAR})$ is the bandwidth upload cost of $\\mathsf{STAR}$."
